### **1. Plan: The "Hybrid Selector" Strategy**

As an **EXPERT**, I confirm that **YES**, this is the single most accurate way to build your tool.

Since MITRE splits the world into "Boxes" (Assets) and "Environments" (Platforms), you cannot ask the user "What Asset is this?" because they might say "AWS" (which is a Platform).

Instead, you must present a **Unified Dropdown** to the user. Behind the scenes, your app will tag each option as either an `ASSET` or a `PLATFORM` and route the logic accordingly.

### **2. The Master List for Your UI**

You should present the following consolidated list to your user. This covers 95% of use cases.

* **Column A:** What the User Sees (Friendly Name)
* **Column B:** What your Code uses (Backend Mapping)

| User Selection (Dropdown) | Backend Type | Backend Value (MITRE ID/String) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Firewall / Security Appliance** | **ASSET** | `Firewall` (A0016) |
| **Router / Gateway** | **ASSET** | `Router` (A0014) |
| **Network Switch** | **ASSET** | `Switch` (A0015) |
| **Server (Physical/Virtual)** | **ASSET** | `Server` (A0013) |
| **Domain Controller / Identity Provider** | **PLATFORM** | `Identity Provider` / `Azure AD` |
| **Cloud Environment (AWS/Azure/GCP)** | **PLATFORM** | `IaaS` |
| **SaaS Application (M365/Salesforce)** | **PLATFORM** | `SaaS` / `Office 365` |
| **Windows Endpoint** | **PLATFORM** | `Windows` |
| **Linux Server/Endpoint** | **PLATFORM** | `Linux` |
| **macOS Endpoint** | **PLATFORM** | `macOS` |
| **Container / Kubernetes** | **PLATFORM** | `Containers` |

### **3. The Logic Flow (Backend Routing)**

When the user makes a selection, your code must "fork" the logic path because Assets and Platforms are queried differently.

#### **Path A: User selects an ASSET (e.g., "Firewall")**

* **Logic:** You are looking for **Targeting**.
* **Query:** Find Techniques where `relationship_type='targets'` AND `target_ref='[Firewall_UUID]'`.
* **Result:** Techniques like **T1562** (Impair Defenses).

#### **Path B: User selects a PLATFORM (e.g., "AWS / IaaS")**

* **Logic:** You are looking for **Applicability**.
* **Query:** Find Techniques where the `x_mitre_platforms` list property contains `"IaaS"`.
* **Result:** Techniques like **T1078** (Valid Cloud Accounts).

### **4. Example: How this improves accuracy**

Let's look at **"Cisco Meraki"**.

* **Scenario 1 (Bad):** You just map it to "Network".
* *Result:* You get generic network noise.


* **Scenario 2 (Good - Your New Approach):**
* User selects: **"Firewall / Security Appliance"** (Asset).
* *Logic:* Your app queries `targets`  `Firewall`.
* *Result:* You explicitly get **T1562.004 (Disable System Firewall)**.
* *Benefit:* This technique **ONLY** appears because you selected the Asset. If you had just selected "Linux" (the OS it runs on), you would have missed this specific firewall-killing technique.



### **5. Summary for the Developer**

Tell your developer:

> *"Create one single dropdown. Use the table above to map each item to either `x-mitre-asset` OR `x-mitre-platforms`. If it's an Asset, query relationships. If it's a Platform, filter the technique list properties."*
